# quarantime

I don't know what to tell you, this is exactly what it looks like.

## Background

I hacked this together on 8 June 2020, on day 2 of my 15-day quarantine in Singapore.
Over the next couple of days, I progressively refined it for polish.

## Motivations

Quarantine is really, really boring, and I wanted to count down to my last day with a way to visualize my progress.
I didn't need event names, background images, or fancy functionality.
I just wanted something **stupidly easy to use** that counted down with a visual progress indicator.

I couldn't find any website that had what I wanted, so I built my own.
